            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>Finding Usability problems:</em></strong><br><strong><em><br></em></strong><br><strong><em>
</em></strong><div>
</div><div>What is usability testing: It is the process of checking the people how they are using our design/creation/building with the main intention of.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;1)Make it easy.
</div><div>&nbsp; 2)Proving that it is easy to use.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Do-it-yourself usability testing</em>: Usability test are qualitative which are different from interviews and surveys which are quantitative. Its purpose is simple to enables us to know what we are building.
</div><div><br></div><div>How it’s done: Basically, a facilitator and a participant are allowed to sit in a room. The participant was given with some task and the facilitator asked the him to think out loud when the user is doing that. Other set of people are watching the whole session though screen sharing software. At the end of the test observers had a debriefing session where they compared notes and discussed what are the problems faced and how they are going to fix that.
</div><div><br></div><div>According to the author’s experience usability tests works even if it is a simple process, it reveals some critical issues.</div><br><div>
</div><div>•	All most all sites have problems.
</div><div>•	All most all serious problems can be easily identified.
</div><div>•	Observing a user makes us a best designer.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Only few organizations use usability testing even though it is simple and valuable because.
</div><div>•	Most people don’t have any experience on usability testing.
</div><div>•	Lack of time for testing.
</div><div>•	Not willing to show the work until and unless it’s finished.</div><br><div>There is demo which demonstrate how to do usability testing to our own web site which will solve many of the critical problems.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Link on the link below to watch 24 minutes of demo.</span></div><div>Demo:	Go to www.rocketsurgerymadeeasy.com watch the “Demo Test” file.</div><br><div><em>Why most people don’t do usability testing</em>: One of the main reason why most of the people don’t prefer doing usability testing because they think that it should be only done for big production- which is referred to as the Big Honkin’ test.</div><br><div>
</div><div>As per author suggestion a round of testing should be performed once in a month with three different users.</div><br><div>
</div><div>On the day of testing three different tests should be done by three different people in the morning and debrief over lunch. By this approach usability testing is done for that month and they can work on fixing the issues before next round of testing.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Do-it-yourself testing in agile</em>: In agile methodology it is very touch to conduct usability test once in month because the life time of a cycle is too short. So, author suggest a new approach called “A morning a sprint”. In this process we will be testing the product more than once in a month with less number of participants and doing some amount of testing remotely which saves lot of time.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Average budget for a year of do-it-yourself testing: Approx. $4000-$6000
</div><div>
</div><div>How to test other people sites: Give people some key inputs which are used to test our site. It’s better if each user works on 3 or more competitor sites. But at the time of debriefing instead of determining the worst things on site discuss the things which are good and which part of the website didn’t go well and from this what lessons can be applied to our web site.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Testing the sketch on the napkin</em>: During early stage of planning of any project we would like to have a rough sketch of the project which will explain the project that the author refers as “sketch on the napkin”.</div><br><div>
</div><div>By showing this sketch on the napkin almost ask simple questions to everyone in the team by this we can understand whether our concept is easy to understand or not.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Testing wireframes: creating wireframes is followed by sketches in web design. Testing wireframes will not be time consuming because there are few people who can do it. Usually it is done in session which includes testing other sites and existing sites as well.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Testing page designs</em>: Next step in wireframes is to create visual treatments of pages. Here wireframes focus on user interaction and visual design.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Who do you test with</em>: Generally, in every team has tester who is familiar with the product. So, it’s better to hire people who is not familiar with the product so that it will be easy to check whether the end user is able to use you the application.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Why three users</em>: Generally, first three users are mostly useful to find out defects and it is also easy when limited people are working on testing to find out the defects.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>The easy way out</em>: If we lack time and we can afford money it’s better to hire a recruiter. We can find lot of options online.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Heir and Spare</em>: Having a substitute available all the time is very important. We have two options while recruiting people.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Just about anybody</em>: It might me some other who is working in other department or the person who working for other company in same building.</div><br><div>
</div><div>•	An “actual user” who we can test with remotely: We can hire a person who will be available on call according to requirement who can handle the situation remotely and able to join the at least for an hour.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Picking tasks to test and writing scenarios for them:</div><br><div>
</div><div>•	First, we must choose the task which we are going to test and the things which the user is going to try.</div><br><div>
</div><div>•	Then we should split the tasks into little scripts, scenarios and add details to the script which we want’s our user to know.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>We should always have some extra task ready for the people who completes the work early. According to the author “filler” task is that the user must perform some actions on one of our competitor’s site.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Making the tasks into scenarios</em>: Scenarios are the scripts which contains details of the task that a user can read and understand. We must phrase the sentences in such a way that it will be clear, easy to read and understand it without any confusion. We should try to keep the text in a simple way by not using uncommon words or unique words which appears on the screen.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Pilot test the scenarios</em>: Once we are done with the scenarios we must do a pre-test which we call it as pilot testing which would take just 15 minutes.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Print them: Once we are done with all the final changes to the script we should print the whole script in two formats.</div><br><div>
</div><div>•	One per sheet for the participants.
</div><div>•	All on one page for us and for observers.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Roles of a facilitator</em>: As a guide we are going to tell the participants what to do and as a therapist we are going to encourage the participants to think this process is called as think loud protocol.
</div><div>Things needed in the test room:  We need to have a system with internet access, screen sharing and screen recording software.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Starting the session</em>: Start the session by reading the script and which explains how our module is going to work. In every session we have pre-question at the start of the session and post -questions at the end of the session which helps every to participate in the session and we can understand whether everyone is able to follow the things which we are doing and by this we can grade the curve. We are going to ask the user to look at the home page and tell us what did they feel about the page.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>The Tasks</em>: At the start of every session we must handle a copy of the scenario to our participants and read it aloud.  Repeat this for every scenario and we can clarify the participants if they have any. IF participants have more doubts we can ask them at the end. Once everything is done we can pay them and show them the door.</div><br><div>
</div><div><em>Prepare for the next test</em>: For the next test we must complete clear our browse, delete the history and start a new screen sharing session. We must open a neutral screen for next test. 
</div><div>A few things to make everyone attend the session:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Make it easy for the people who are attending the session, advertise and make it clear that they are looking at it’s good if we provide the snacks to the participants.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Strategies for Fixing Usability problems:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The purpose of debriefing session has been clearly defined. By the time we come out of the door we need to have two things.</div><div>
</div><div>•	A list of most major problems which occurred during usability testing .
</div><div>•	A set of problems which we are going to fix in next round of testing.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">We must fix most serious problems first.</span></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><em>How to run the debriefing meeting</em>: The person who is going to run the test should run the debriefing session. Start the meeting with a glance of what we are going to do. We should ask everyone to go through the list of problem they have noted down and ask them to list any three problems which they feel as serious problem. Once they figure out the problems move around the room and ask the participates to read aloud. Finally, select ten problems out of these and based on the severity and discuss with the team how we are going to fix them. After the session it’s good to summarize everything which went in the session and in a form of short email.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The author suggests the below two principles for doing as little as possible: 
</div><div>•	Tweak, don’t redesign.
</div><div>•	Take something away.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The Road Ahead:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><em>Remote testing</em>: This is the process where we reach our users remotely by screen sharing session and over phone.
</div><div>By remote testing we have following advantages: 
</div><div>•	Easier recruiting.
</div><div>•	No travel required.
</div><div>•	Easier scheduling.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Unmoderated remote testing: A service like “usertesting.com” can be used for unmoderated testing. One just must give them URL for what the test needs to be done and tasks. Provide them information about the kind of participants one is looking for and preferences like age group, computer experience, gender. Usertesting.com will put the request online to their pool of testers. Each user browses to the given URL and gives the test. Usertesting.com returns the screen recording of the participants.

</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;Chapter 1:</em></strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Don’t make me think:
</em></strong></p><p>Every web site which we are going designing should be self-explanatory. It should be very easy to get it without spending much time on it to understand.  For instance, a person who is new to this web site should be able to easily figure out which button has which functionality he/she should be able to navigate easily to all the pages. Generally, representing the content with images is much preferred that writing the content inform of text which avoid lot of questions for the user.
</p><p>Things that make us think:
</p><p>All stuff in the website makes us to think unnecessarily. For example, unfamiliar technical terms. Every button should be designed in such a way that the user can easily understand what will happen if he clicks that button.
</p><p>The website or the application which we are designing should be interactive and helpful for the user. For instance, when a user trying to search for a ting over the web site it should show up the things as suggestions related to that search which helps the user to search the tings quickly.
</p><p>You can’t make	everything self-evident:
</p><p>It’s every tough to make everything self-evident on a web site but this can be achieved by using good colour combinations, text size and layouts. The most important note this that when we are not able to make that self -evident we should try to make the design as self-explanatory.
</p><p>Why is	all of this so important?
</p><p>On the internet, the competition is too high when we frustrate our user then there are cent percent changes of losing our customers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Chapter 2:</em></strong></p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>&nbsp;How	we really use the Web</strong></em>
</p><p>SCANNING, SATISFICING, AND MUDDLING THROUGH
</p><p>&nbsp;Why are things	always	in the last place	you look for them? Because you stop looking when you find them!
</p><p>—CHILDREN’S RIDDLE
</p><p>It is always different how people use the web site and how they actually use them.When  we’re designing a web page we think that people will carefull read all the content witch is written on the web page .
</p><p>What people does is they just give a glance at each page and scan the whole page where they can find some catchy key words or links.
</p><p>FACT OF LIFE #1:  We don’t read pages.	We scan them.
</p><p>Why do we scan?
</p><p>•	We’re usually on a mission: Most of the web use involves in getting something done so the users want to be done it quickly.
</p><p>•	We know we don’t need to read everything:  Generally, users are not interested in everything which is written on the web page they look for the data which is useful for them so they scan the web page.
</p><p>•	We’re good at it:When we read a newes paper or a magazine we just skim the pages so most of people are good at doing that. They look for the data which is useful for them.
</p><p>When we’re designing a web page, we assume that the content which we are updating in the site will be the best. But it is totally wrong we just update the stuff which come first to our mind and feel that it will be useful for the user.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 3:
</strong></em></p><p>DESIGNING FOR SCANNING, NOT READING:
</p><p>We must keep following things in mind form user point of view how they will be scanning the page.
</p><p>Conventions are your friends
</p><p>Follow the web page conventions as user expects
</p><p>Some of the basic things that a user expects is that the logo will be placed on the left hand top corner of the web page and if there is ant search bar it will be placed on the right hand top corner and also not only following web page conventions user should feel that it is wort using our webpage .
</p><p>Create effective visual hierarchies:
</p><p>One of the important thing is that the images which we are using in our web site should be eye catching and they should be large so that the user can easily observe the image.
</p><p>Things that are connect with each other should be grouped under a same hood so that the user can easily identify the item for example in an ecommerce site all the workout product should be place under work out section in the left-hand menu list.
</p><p>Cursor shape should be changed to hand from arrow once the cursor is moved on to the product and the color of the links should be differentiated from visited links to unvisited links.
</p><p>One should take care while designing a home page if lot of stuff is kept on the home page user finds it to be too difficult to identify the things this is called clutter and every item which are placed on the webpage should be in good organized way.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 4:
</strong></em></p><p>Why users like mindless choices:
</p><p>Generally, we find lot of choices over web. Making a choice on the webpage mindless feels good for the user. For instance, when I am trying to buy a product at my home office it shows an option where I can select the option whether I am buying the product for my home or for my office.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 5:
</strong></em></p><p>The art of not writing for the web:
</p><p>Five or six things which author had learned in the college and he was stuck with one point which is E. B. White’s seventeenth rule in The Elements of Style
</p><p>There are two specific kind of this which are useful while a website are:
</p><p>•	Happy talk must die.
</p><p>•	Instructions must die.
</p><p>Happy talk must die: Happy talk is kind of self-congratulatory promotional which we generally find on bad written broachers. This writing says how good they are and what they did which is not considered as a useful information.
</p><p>Instructions must die: Every site should be self-explanatory and instructions to the user must be eliminated completely. If in case we encountered with a situation where we have to put some instructions the  they should be reduced to minimal.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 6:
</strong></em></p><p>Street signs and Breadcrumbs: Designing navigation
</p><p>When we usually trying to find something, we have two options:
</p><p>&nbsp;1)To ask someone.
</p><p>&nbsp;2)To browse over internet.
</p><p>If we choose second option we follow a hierarchy approach by following signs to guide us. Eventually, if are unable to find the thing which we are looking for we’ll leave.
</p><p>When we decided to return to the website it is better to use conceptual hierarchy or retrace our steps instead of using physical sense. This is one of the main reason why bookmarks are used we can come back to the website which we had visited for our search.
</p><p>Web navigation conventions: These are conventions which are generally used by all website. Generally, all users are used to this type of conventions. For instance, logo of a website is placed at left hand top corner and when we click on the log we are navigated to home page and search bar for a website is placed at right hand top corner. Web designers generally uses persistent navigation (or global navigation) to describe the set of navigations that appears on every page of website and one of the most important thing in global navigation is the button or link which navigates to thee home page.
</p><p>Utilities are one of the most important things in a website such as contact us or help buttons which helps the user to find out what he/she is looking for.
</p><p>There are four important things to be followed page naming.
</p><p>•	Every page should be named.
</p><p>•	The name should be placed at a right place.
</p><p>•	The name should be prominent.
</p><p>•	The name should be matched with what a user is clicking.
</p><p>Enabling tab functionality to a web site is very good because it is self-evident, hard to miss, they’re slick and they suggest a physical space.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 7: The	Big	Bang	Theory	of	Web	Design
</strong></em></p><p>Main important thing for a website is home page. Every visitor gets an opinion on the website by looking at the home page. Home page should be designed in an orderly manner so that it will be easy for a visitor to get an idea about the website.  
</p><p>There are two important places on a page where we expect some statements which describes what is the site about.
</p><p>•	The tag line below the logo which is directly related to the logo. This is used as the description of the web site.
</p><p>•	The welcome blurb is the thing which is the description of the site, displayed in a prominent block on the Home page that’s visible without scrolling.
</p><p>We should provide as much space as we can provide and we shouldn’t use mission statements as welcome blurbs.
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 8: “The	Farmer and	the Cowman Should Be	Friends”
</strong></em></p><p>Why most web design team arguments about usability are a waste of time, and how to avoid them
</p><p>Generally, every member in web development team will feel that usability is waste of time and try to spend most of the time on the same issue over and over and they also feel that the things which the like on the website will be liked by everyone but is a false myth. It’s better to hire a set of people for testing the website so that it will be helpful to find out the user point of view.
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 9: Usability Testing on 10 cents a day
</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Focus groups are not usability testing:
</strong></em></p><p>In focus group all people in small group should sit together and discuss about the product and their experience for the new concepts. It is best because we will be able to understand user demands and what they are expecting. This process is good at the planning stage of the project.
</p><p>In usability testing, at the process of prototyping or at the time of design we can find out many things which will frustrates the user.
</p><p><em><strong>Several true things about usability testing:
</strong></em></p><p>To design a good website, it is mandatory to test because a developer will have spent lot of time to develop the website all the time which he spent on the website should not be layman.
</p><p><em><strong>How often you should test?
</strong></em></p><p>Testing of the site should be done once in a month which will help us to find the bugs early and fix them and one more important thing is that it will be helpful the developer to understand what the user is expecting.
</p><p><em><strong>How many users do you need?
</strong></em></p><p>Generally, we will be requiring three users to test the data. First three users will be finding out the all defects in the product and it is easy to maintain the people in small group.
</p><p><strong><em>How do you Choose the participants?
</em></strong></p><p>Selecting the participants who are not anyway related to the domain is useful because it will be help us to find out how one can understand our product even if they don’t have any idea about the product.
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<em><strong>How do you choose the task to test?
</strong></em></p><p>At the start of every session we must handle a copy of the scenario to our participants and read it aloud.  Repeat this for every scenario and we can clarify the participants if they have any. IF participants have more doubts we can ask them at the end. Once everything is done we can pay them and show them the door.
</p><p><em><strong>What Happens in the test?
</strong></em></p><p>•	First, we must choose the task which we are going to test and the things which the user is going to try.
</p><p>•	Then we should split the tasks into little scripts, scenarios and add details to the script which we want’s our user to know.
</p><p><em><strong>Debriefing:
</strong></em></p><p>The person who is going to run the test should run the debriefing session. Start the meeting with a glance of what we are going to do. We should ask everyone to go through the list of problem they have noted down and ask them to list any three problems which they feel as serious problem. Once they figure out the problems move around the room and ask the participates to read aloud. Finally, select ten problems out of these and based on the severity and discuss with the team how we are going to fix them. After the session it’s good to summarize everything which went in the session and in a form of short email.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 10: Mobile:	It’s	not	just	a	city	in	Alabama	anymore
</strong></em></p><p><em>Mobile phones being a handheld device have a small screen, one cannot show all the features that are available in the desktop version of the site. So a mobile-first approach must be followed. In mobile-first approach, only those features must be included which are most necessary for the user.
</em><em>One should also provide the desktop version must be provided for users who are familiar and comfortable using the desktop version. Nonmobile versions should allow zoom functionality, this makes user zoom and look for the information.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>
</em><em>If the mobile version has content in abundance it will take more time to load on the mobile device. This can frustrate a user. So mobile version should have content which is necessary.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It can be a unique selling point of the application if it has some edge over the competition. A tutorial of how the application can be used when the application is launched the first time makes the application learnable. And its self-explanatory design makes it easily learnable if the user forgets how to use the app.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>To test a mobile application one can mount the camera on the phone. This will make it easy for a participant to use the phone naturally.</em></p><p><em><strong>Chapter 11: Usability as common courtesy</strong></em></p><p>According to the author site should be clean and self-explanatory because we don’t know when will a user leave the site if we don’t provide him with the exact information what they required.
</p><p>Few things that we must keep in mind while designing the website.
</p><p>•	We shouldn’t keep the information hidden from the user.
</p><p>•	We should as the user about the information which is not needed at all.
</p><p>•	When the site is not organized.
</p><p><em><strong>Chapter 12:&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>Accessibility and you:</strong></em></p><p>Every site should be made accessible to use so that it will be helpful for many people. Some companies use some tools to check the we whether the site is accessible or not which won’t provide exact results. For instance, 
visually impared people uses screen reader to read the text which is been displayed on the screen so our web site should be incorprated with this functionalities .</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 13:&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Guide for the perplexed:</em></strong></p><p>In this chapter author gives us a clear idea how to convince our supervisor for conduction usability testing. This can be achieved by showing a demo and what are the benefits we can get by conducting usability testing and other way is to compare our site with our competitor &nbsp;site.</p><p>
